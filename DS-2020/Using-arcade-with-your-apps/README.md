# ArcGIS API for JavaScript: Using Arcade with Your Apps

This session will demonstrate how you can transform your data from one or more field values to computed data values for use in data visualizations, popup content, and labels. This session will start by providing a begginer's overview to the Arcade language. Then we'll show how you can use Arcade in advanced workflows to create immersive web apps for data exploration. We'll also demonstrate some tips and tricks for debugging Arcade expressions and point out how you can avoid common pitfalls. The session will close with a peek into the latest features introduced in Arcade and provide some hints of what you can expect in the future.
