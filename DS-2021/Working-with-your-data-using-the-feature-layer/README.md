## Summary

Explore the capabilities of the feature layer that directly connects to your data. In this session you will learn how to create, display, and edit data using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript's FeatureLayer. We will cover styling features using renderer, filtering the displayed data, and configuring a popup. Then you will learn more about how to craft your client-side FeatureLayer, to take advantage of the FeatureLayer against any dataset.
