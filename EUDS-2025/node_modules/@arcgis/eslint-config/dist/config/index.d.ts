/**
 * See setup documentation & rationale behind ESLint:
 * https://qawebgis.esri.com/components/monorepo/support-packages/eslint
 *
 * Some advice on editing rules:
 * - prioritize autofixable rules to make adoption in existing codebases easier
 * - disable redundant rules (rules redundant with TypeScript, or each other),
 *   to reduce noise and performance impact
 * - if rule is always auto-fixable, it may be a good idea to emit it as a
 *   warning instead of an error to be less disruptive when the developer is
 *   typing code
 * - emit rules that have a lot of false positives as warnings instead of errors
 * - provide justification for enabling opinionated rules
 * - provide justification for disabling default rules
 * - if rule is disabled because it's buggy, describe how so
 *   (code sample, GitHub issue, permalink to file, etc)
