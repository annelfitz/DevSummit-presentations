# Better UX with Popups: Creating Custom Actions & VisibleElements

### Project description

This application demonstrates how to create custom actions and control visible elements in ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript Popups. 
It also showcases the new popup ordering default behavior added at version 4.29.
Features returned to the popup now respect map layer order when there are multiple layers along with drawing order for individual layers.
Read more about this new feature in the version [4.29 release notes](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/release-notes/#feature-order-in-the-popup-and-features-widget).
